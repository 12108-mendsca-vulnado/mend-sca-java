        Body="<p>The proposal for this site only mentions "Arabic." Which Arabic?</p> <p>There is a common type of Arabic called "classical Arabic" (fusha) which stretches back at least 1000 years back. It's still used today for most media (eg. newspapers, textbooks) and in universities.</p> <p>Beyond this, each country has its own dialect (or slang) version of Arabic. This includes both use of vocabulary, and also actual grammar (or ignoring the classical grammar).</p> <p>While some of the sample questions on Area 51 talk about Arabic in a specific area, the question is really how we should plan and organize questions, or whether we should focus exclusively on classical Arabic.</p> "
